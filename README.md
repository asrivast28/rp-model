# RP-model
This repository contains the code for generating a network using the RP-model proposed by Sabrin et al. [1].
It can also be used for computing various hourglass network metrics for the generated network (or an existing network) e.g., Core Size, H-score, etc.
The usage of this code can be printed by executing the following command.

```
python hourglass.py --help
```
